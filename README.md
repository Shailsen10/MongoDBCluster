Change machine "didnasiina6" replace it with your hostname/IP in files:
- **ONE_TIME_START_AND_CONFIGURE_SERVERS.BAT**
- **mongos.conf**

For the first time run **ONE_TIME_START_AND_CONFIGURE_SERVERS.BAT** will setup and start the server's. (don't need to run **START.bat** after this)

For future run's use **START.bat** (don't run **ONE_TIME_START_AND_CONFIGURE_SERVERS.BAT**)
